`cp_koopmans` contains the main CP-based (v4.1) Koopmans code \
`qe_koopmans` a fork of QE that contains also the wannier2odd interface (see below for installation details) \
`unfold_and_interpolate` submodule containing the Python code for band structure unfolding and interpolation (you might want to check also its README)
