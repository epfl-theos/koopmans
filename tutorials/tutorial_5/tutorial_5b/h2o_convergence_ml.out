 Koopmans spectral functional calculations with Quantum ESPRESSO

 version 1.0.0b4

 Written by Edward Linscott, Riccardo De Gennaro, and Nicola Colonna

 Please cite the papers listed in h2o_convergence_ml.bib in work involving this calculation
UserWarning: This system is not cubic and will therefore not have a uniform dielectric tensor. However, the image-correction schemes that are currently implemented assume a uniform dielectric. Proceed with caution
UserWarning: Predicting screening parameters with machine-learning is an experimental feature; proceed with caution
