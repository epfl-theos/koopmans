@title@   H2 molecule
==============================================================================
  
  H2 molecule ina box calculated using different methods: 
  nspin = 1:      LDA, NK0, NK, PZ, HF    (suffix:   none)
  nspin = 2:      LDA, NK0, NK, PZ, HF    (suffix:  _spin)
  traditional     LDA, NK0, NK, PZ, HF    (suffix:  _trad)

  The calculations labelled as traditional adopt the traditional
  input convention (where almost all the variables are set explicitly).
  Such inputs are suitable to be run with older versions of the code,
  to have a historical check of the results.
