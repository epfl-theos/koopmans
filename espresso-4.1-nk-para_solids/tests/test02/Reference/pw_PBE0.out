     Parallel version (MPI), running on     4 processors
     R & G space division:  proc/pool =    4

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Waiting for input...
     Reading input from standard input

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PBE0 ( 6 4 8 4 0)
     EXX-fraction              =        0.25
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
