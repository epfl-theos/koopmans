\chapter*{Introduction}
\section*{Getting Help}
The latest version of \wannier\ and documentation can always
be found at \url{http://www.wannier.org}.

There is a \wannier\ mailing list for discussing issues in the
development, theory, coding and algorithms pertinent to MLWF.
You can register for this mailing list by following the links at
\url{http://www.wannier.org/forum.html}

Finally, many frequently asked questions are answered in
Appendix~\ref{chap:faq}.

\section*{Credits}
The present release of \wannier\ was written by Arash A. Mostofi
(Imperial College London, UK), Giovanni Pizzi (EPFL, Switzerland), Ivo Souza 
(Universidad del Pais Vasco, Spain) and
Jonathan R. Yates (University of
Oxford, UK). Contributors to the code include
Young-Su Lee (KIST, S. Korea), 
Matthew Shelley (Imperial College London, UK)
and Nicolas Poilvert (Harvard University, USA).
 \wannier\ is
based on the Fortran 77 codes written for isolated bands by Nicola Marzari
and David Vanderbilt, for entangled bands by Ivo Souza, Nicola Marzari,
and David Vanderbilt, and for quantum transport by Marco Nardelli.

Acknowledgements: Stefano de Gironcoli (SISSA, Trieste, Italy) for the
\pwscf\ interface, Timo Thonhauser and Graham Lopez (Wake Forest, USA) 
extended this to add terms needed for orbital magnetisation
; Michel Posternak (EPFL, Switzerland) for the
original plotting routines, Raffaello Bianco (University of Trieste) for improvements to the k-slice plotting. Daniel Aberg (LLNL, USA) for povray plotting routines, w90vdw is written by
Lampros Andrinopoulos, Nicholas D. M. Hine and Arash A. Mostofi at Imperial College London.
