 The Maximally-Localised Generalised Wannier Functions Code 


 Wannier90 Version 2.0 has been written by: 
    Arash A. Mostofi   (Imperial College London, UK)
    Giovanni Pizzi     (EPFL, Switzerland)
    Ivo Souza          (Universidad del Pais Vasco, Spain)
    Jonathan R. Yates  (University of Oxford, UK)

 Contributors to the code include:
  Young-Su Lee (KIST, S. Korea) -- specialised Gamma point routines & transport
  Matthew Shelley (Imperial College London, UK) -- transport
  Nicolas Poilvert (Penn State University, USA) -- transport
  Raffaello Bianco (Univ. Pierre et Marie Curie Paris 6 and CNRS) -- 
    k-slice plotting
  Gabriele Sclauzero (ETH, Zurich, Switzerland) -- disentanglement
    in spheres in k-space

 w90vdw was written by:
   Lampros Andrinopoulos, Nicholas D. M. Hine and Arash A. Mostofi
 w90pov (povray plotting) was written by:
   Daniel Aberg (LLNL, USA)
 
We gratefully acknowledge Marco Buongiorno Nardelli for the dosqc
v1.0 subroutines for the calculation of the density of states and the
quantum transport, upon which transport.f90 is based.
