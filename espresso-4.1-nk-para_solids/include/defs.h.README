                       CONFIGURATION FILES

You shouldn't need to edit the following files. The two first are 
automatically generated by "configure".

* include/fft_defs.h
  ==================
   automatically generated by configure using include/fft_defs.h.in
   as template - included in Modules/fft_scalar.f90
   contains the type for C pointers called by fortran:
      C_POINTER is integer*8 for 64-bit machines,
                   integer*4 on most other machines
   DO NOT add C-style comments! some fortran compilers do not like them

* include/c_defs.h
  ================
   automatically generated by configure using include/c_defs.h.in
   as template - included in C files in clib/ . Contains:

1) #define HAVE_MALLINFO
   if the mallinfo structure is present (Linux, AIX)

2) Macros redefining C symbols so that Fortran finds them
      F77_FUNC, F77_FUNC_
   C routine 'name' in *.c files are defined as 
      F77_FUNC('name','NAME')
   if 'name' does not contain an underscore; if it does, as
      F77_FUNC_('name','NAME')

   Absoft: convert to capital, no added underscores 
      #define F77_FUNC(name,NAME) NAME
      #define F77_FUNC_(name,NAME) NAME
   XLF, HP-UX: convert to lowercase, no added underscores 
      #define F77_FUNC(name,NAME) name
      #define F77_FUNC_(name,NAME) name
   G95, EKOPath, Alpha Linux: convert to lowercase, add one underscore 
   if the name does not contain underscores, add two if it does
      #define F77_FUNC(name,NAME) name ## _
      #define F77_FUNC_(name,NAME) name ## __
   Most other cases: convert to lowercase, add one underscore 
      #define F77_FUNC(name,NAME) name ## _
      #define F77_FUNC_(name,NAME) name ## _

* include/f_defs.h
  ================

   contains definitions to be included in FORTRAN files ONLY
   DO NOT add C-style comments! some fortran compilers do not like them
   Defines on output:
      Blas/Lapack names  lowercase and with underscores appended if requested
      iargc,             system libraries that need to be redefined (i.e.
      getarg, getenv     add an underscore) in some specific cases
      CMPLX              force it to produce double-precision numbers
      DREAL DIMAG DCMPLX redefined as fake names to prevent their usage
 
* iotk/include/iotk_config.h
  =========================
   contains definitions for iotk . Defines on output:
      __IOTK_REAL1       kind for single-precision reals
      __IOTK_REAL2       kind for double-precision reals
      __IOTK_WORKAROUND* various workarounds for miscellaneous compiler bugs
