TO DO
-----

* implementation of the inner_loop to make the effective
  NK hamiltonian hermitean (Pederson condition, Klupfel impl) 
  (CHP)

* Smearing in NK-CPV (formualtion using full occupation matrices)
  (AF)

* Implement NK-GGA.
  (partly done)


* Implement NK with hybrid functionals (B3LYP, etc.).

* Test interatomic forces in NK-CPV.

* Implement interatomic forces based 
  on numerical derivatives (for numerical consistency).

* Interatomic forces seem less accurate 
  when used with NK in comparison with LSD.


DONE
-----

* Suppress the redundant calculation of the total 
  electronic density in nksiclib.f90 and eelib.f90. 
  (around 2010 May 12-18th)

* Implement US PPs in NK-CPV.
  (started 2010 Aug 06, cleanup on 2010 Oct 10, bug fixed on 2010 Nov 22)

* Test HF in NK-CPV.
  (HF optimization and testing on 2010 Aug 24, test suite on 2010 Nov 20)

* Test electric field in NK-CPV.
  (fully tested through the 2010, test suite on 2010 Nov 20)

* Gram-Schmidt seems to be stuck 
  with the parallel version of 11/25/2009.
  (solved)
