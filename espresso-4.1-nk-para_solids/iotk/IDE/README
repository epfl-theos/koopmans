                S3DE -- S3 Development Environment
=====================================================================

This package is a suite of scripts used to manage an environment
suitable for code development. Automatic Makefile generation, versions, 
portability among different systems and library loading are some
of the main tasks of the DE.

             autoconf-generated scripts.
