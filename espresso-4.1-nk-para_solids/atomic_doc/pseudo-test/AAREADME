This directory contains a few examples of pseudo-potentials tests.
The outputs are in the directory "reference/". Input data:

s.in       Test a NC pseudo-potential (old format)
ni.in      Test a US pseudo-potential pseudotype=3 (old format)
rh.in      Test a US pseudo-potentials with NLCC (UPF format)
al.in      Test a NC pseudo-potential pseudotype=1 (old format)
ga.in      Test a NC relativistic pseudo-potential pseudotype=1
as.in      Test a NC relativistic pseudo-potential (UPF format)

The script test.job runs ld1.x on these examples, writes the outputs
into directory "results/", compares them with reference outputs and
writes the differences between these files into file "difference".
