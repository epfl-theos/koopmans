This directory contains a few examples of pseudo-potential generation.
The outputs are in the directory "reference/". Input data:

al.in        Generates a NC pseudo-potential pseudotype=1 
as.in        Generates a NC relativistic pseudo-potential pseudotype=2
o.in         Generates a US pseudo-potential RRKJ3 pseudotype=3 
pt.in        Generates a US relativistic pseudo-potential pseudotype=3
si_nc.in     Generates a NC pseudo-potential tm  pseudotype=1
si_nc_paw.in Generates the reconstruction file for PAW

The script test.job runs ld1.x on these examples, writes the outputs
into directory "results/", compares them and the generated pseudo-potentials
with reference data, writes the differences between these files into file
"difference".
