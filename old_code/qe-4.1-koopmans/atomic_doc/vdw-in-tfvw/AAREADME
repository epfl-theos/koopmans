This directory contains few examples of calculating van der Waals coefficients for 
closed-shell ions in Thomas-Fermi and von Weizsaecker approximation (experimental).
The outputs are in the directory reference.

The script test.job runs ld1.x on these examples (output in results dir.)
and compares the calculated C6 coefficients with those contained in reference 
(see file compare.dat).
