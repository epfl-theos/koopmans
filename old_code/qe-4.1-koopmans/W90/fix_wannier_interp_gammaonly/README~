A first attempt to fix the problem
It highly work in progress
Some of the known problems are:

1. if there is a truly periodic system in a small cell and ndegen!=1, the new interpolation routine (used e.g. by geninterp) does the wrong thing
2. I'm not sure of the matrix conversions from abs to rel coords, double check!
3. things can be done more efficiently
4.
