     Program PWSCF     v.4.1    starts ...
     Today is  8Dec2010 at 14:11:44 

     Parallel version (MPI)

     Number of processors in use:       6
     R & G space division:  proc/pool =    6

     For Norm-Conserving or Ultrasoft (Vanderbilt) Pseudopotentials or PAW

     Current dimensions of program pwscf are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Waiting for input...

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a parallel distributed memory algorithm will be used,
     eigenstates matrixes will be distributed block like on
     ortho sub-group =    2*   2 procs
