@title@   H-H, Li-H, Be-H  molecules from the G2 set
==============================================================================
  
  Simple diatomic hydrides from the G2 set. NK is done directly from the
  beginning and the traditional input is used. Convenient to check
  old versions of the code.

  Note that Be and Li pseudopot have core-corrections.

  ATOMIZATION ENERGIES [kcal/mol]

           LDA[G2]    PBE[G2]    CCSD(T)[G2]    Ref.
=======================================================
   H-H      106.6      98.3         102.4      103.3
  Li-H       58.8      51.5          54.9       56.0   
  Be-H       57.1      52.5          46.2       46.9

Note: at the moment atomization energies are not computed by NK
      (we are missing the isolated atom calculations)
