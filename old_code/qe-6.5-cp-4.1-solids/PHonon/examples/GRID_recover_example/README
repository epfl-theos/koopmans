This example illustrate the possibility to recover a ph.x calculation
made on a GRID or using images.
run_example tests the calculation of the phonon dispersion on the GRID and
is similar to example of GRID_example. The calculation
is however stopped with max_seconds and recovered.
run_example_2 tests the same calculation made in Image_example 
recovering a calculation that uses the images feature.
