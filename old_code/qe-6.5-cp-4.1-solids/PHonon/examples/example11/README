This example tests pw.x and ph.x for the noncollinear/spin-orbit case and PAW.

The calculation proceeds as follows:

1) make a self-consistent calculation for Au
   (input=Au.scf_pz.in, output=Au.scf_pz.out).

2) make a phonon calculation at the Gamma point (input=Au.phG_pz.in,
   output=Au.phG_pz.out).

3) make a phonon calculation at the X point (input=Au.phX_pz.in,
   output=Au.phX_pz.out).
