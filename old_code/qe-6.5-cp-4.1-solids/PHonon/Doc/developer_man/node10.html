7 Suggestion for developers</A>
</H1>

<P>
If you plan to add something to the <TT>PHonon</TT> package follow these
simple rules:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>All quantities that do not require the perturbed wavefunctions, are
calculated in setup or by calling a separate routine in <TT>phq_init</TT>. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The quantities that require the perturbed wavefunctions due to an
electric field are calculated by a separate routine after 
<TT>solve_e</TT> in the routine <TT>phescf</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The quantities that require the perturbed wavefunctions due to an
atomic displacement are accumulated by calling a separate routine
in phqscf after <TT>solve_linter</TT>. 
NB: the perturbed wavefunctions are saved in a file that is rewritten at
each new <TT>irrep</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>After calculating a quantity, it has to be saved in the directory
<TT>outdir</TT> in an <TT>.xml</TT> file, by adding it to the list 
of variables in the routine <TT>write_tensors</TT>  
(preferable), or by writing a routine similar to <TT>write_tensors</TT> 
that writes a separate file. The same quantity must be read by 
<TT>read_tensors</TT> or by writing a separate routine.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If you introduce the calculation of a new quantity in the phonon code 
and save it in the <TT>.xml</TT> file, please add also the associated flags 
that control the calculation: 
<TT>lquantity</TT> is read in input and tells <TT>ph.x</TT> that that quantity must be 
calculated, <TT>done_quantity</TT> tells <TT>ph.x</TT> that that quantity 
was available in the <TT>.xml</TT> files and should not be recalculated, 
<TT>comp_quantity</TT> can be introduced if the quantity depends on 
<B>q</B> or on the frequency and tells <TT>ph.x</TT> that that quantity must be 
calculated in this run. The image controller can divide the work among images
by setting the array <TT>comp_quantity</TT>. At each <B>q</B> point and 
at each frequency the quantity must be saved in the <TT>.xml</TT> file.
Please update the image controller to add the additional work that the 
calculation of your quantity involves and make a single image calculate it 
or divide the work among different images.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Please, try to avoid opening files inside routines.
Files must be opened in <TT>openfilq</TT> and closed in <TT>close_phq</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Global variables must be allocated in <TT>allocate_phq</TT>, directly in the 
routine, or by calling a separate routine that allocates all
your new variables. The same variables must be deallocated in 
<TT>deallocate_phq</TT>, by a separate routine or by adding them to the
list of variables. Note that at each new <B>q</B> point these variables are
deallocated and reallocated. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Variables that control the grid should not be deallocated at
each new <B>q</B> point must be allocated in <TT>allocate_grid_variables</TT> 
and deallocated in <TT>destroy_status_run</TT>.
A few arrays that must be read from input are allocated in 
<TT>phq_readin</TT> after reading their size and deallocated in
<TT>destroy_status_run</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Preferably global variables are calculated by in a single routine 
and used by the other routines. In particular routines are not allowed to 
modify:

<UL>
<LI>The variables calculated by <TT>pw.x</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>The modes.
</LI>
<LI>The variables that describe the symmetry of the small group of <B>q</B>.
</LI>
<LI>The variables that describe the response of the ultrasoft quantities
        (e.g. <TT>int1</TT>, <TT>int2</TT>, ..., <TT>alphasum</TT>, 
<TT>becsum</TT>, <TT>dpqq</TT>, etc.).
</LI>
</UL>
If you need to modify these quantities, please allocate new variables 
and copy the variables of the phonon on them.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If you want to establish a new recover point, add the appropriate
<TT>rec_code</TT> in the list above. The point in which the code stopped 
is saved in <TT>prefix.phsave/status_run.xml</TT>. 

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If you are searching for some interesting project to contribute to the
<TT>PHonon</TT> package, please read the header of <TT>phonon.f90</TT>
and implement some feature that is not yet ready. Ideally all quantities
should be at level [10], presently level [5] is still experimental and
some quantities are at level [1].
