6 The routines of the PHonon package</A>
</H1>

<P>
The routines of the <TT>PHonon</TT> package can be divided in groups of  
related task. There are high level drivers that call the
routines that do the actual work and low level routines that make
a single task. Note that the phonon code is tightly integrated in the QE
package, so it uses the routines provided by the 
<TT>Modules</TT> or by the <TT>PW/src</TT> directories. Only a brief comment
on the purpose and the use of the routines can be found here. More details
might be written inside the routines themselves. We report here the name of the
file that contains the routines. Each file might contain more than one
routine. Unfortunately sometimes there is no correspondence between the name of
the file and the name of the routine. This is mainly for historical reasons.
We adopt the following convention: if the file and the routine contained inside
have the same name we report only the filename; if the file contains a single
routine with a different name or more than one routine, we report in 
parenthesis the routine name.

<P>
Modules that contain the variables used by <TT>ph.x</TT>:

<P>
<PRE>
phcom.f90  Almost all global variables are here.
elph.f90   Variables needed for the electron-phonon part.

variables are allocated by <TT>phq_readin</TT> and by <TT>ph_restart</TT>.

<P>
<PRE>
allocate_phq.f90    This is the main allocation routine in which almost 
                    all global variables are allocated. It needs only the 
                    dimensions defined in pw.x.
allocate_part.f90   Allocate quantities for the partial computation of
                    the dynamical matrix. It is called in phq_readin.

deallocate_phq.f90  Deallocate all the ph.x variables allocated in 
                    allocate_phq. The variables allocated in phq_readin

                    contained in ph_restart.

             most significant are: the local+SCF potential, derivatives
             of xc potential, using dmxc or similar functions and setup_dgc,
             alpha_pv and occupated bands, rotation matrices on the

                 from the perturbation. It calls dynmatcc, d2ionq, and 
                 dynmat_us. This routine is called by init_phq.

                 local and nonlocal potentials.

                 the potential. There are terms due to the change of the
                 augmentation function.

                 of the wavefunctions.

                 to the change of the wavefunctions (Only the contribution
                 of the nonlocal PP). Called at each k point.        
drhodvloc.f90    As drhodvnl for the local potential. It can be calculated
                 as an integral of the potential and the induced charge 
                 density.
drhodvus.f90     A term present only in the US/PAW case. Integral of the
                 induced SCF potential and the change of the charge at
                 fixed wavefunctions. It is called in solve_linter because
                 the induced potential is not available outside.      

dynmatrix.f90    Is a driver that collects the dynamical matrix, checks if
                 all representations have been calculated, symmetrize the
                 dynamical matrix, computes the matrices rotated in all 
                 equivalent q and diagonalizes the matrix. The same is
                 done for zue.
