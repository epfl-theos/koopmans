     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on       4 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                 4
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     K-points division:     npool     =       2
     band groups division:  nbgrp     =       2

     Reading data from directory:
     ./si.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PZ ( 1  1  0  0 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
