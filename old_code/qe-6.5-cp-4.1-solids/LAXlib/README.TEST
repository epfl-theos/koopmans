This library provides a Testing and Timing code
to asses the performance of Linear Algebra subroutines, 
estimate the scalability and the size of your simulation.

To compile the test program, once you have properly
configure QE, go inside the directory LAXlib and
type:
	make TEST

Then you can run your LA tests using command like:

	mpirun -np 4 ./la_test.x -n 1024

or, in case of serial build

	./la_test.x -n 1024

where 1024 is the size of the matrix to be processed.
