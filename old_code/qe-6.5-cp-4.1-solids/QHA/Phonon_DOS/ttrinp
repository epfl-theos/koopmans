4  - total number of tetrahedra vertexes
1  - number of tetrahera comprising the IBZ
16 - each tetrahedra edge is divided by 16

Next lines are vertex coordinates in cartesian

Next 4 integer numbers are for tetrahedra vertex order (i.e.  how they are connected, 
     in this particular case from point 1 to 4 thoroghout 2 and 3)
