to run examples do

./run_example 

from the following directories: 

example01 computes the GW quasi-particle energies in CH4 (Methene molecule) 

example02 computes the GW quasi-particle energies in bulk Si (how to treat extended system)
             Note: in order to accelerate this example, used as a daily distribution test,
                     it is using parameters (a small 8-atom simulation cell whose Brillouin's zone 
                     is sample onlt at the Gamma point) giving quite unconverged results
example04     computes the dielectric function of Ag with simple_ip

example 05    computes the dielectric function of Si with simple_bse
