        NB: The calculation will not necessary use all these r_paw values.
            - For a edge in the electric-dipole approximation,
              only the r_paw(l=1) values are used.
            - For a K edge in the electric-quadrupole approximation,
              only the r_paw(l=2) values are used.

            - For a L2 or L3 edge in the electric-quadrupole approximation,

              all projectors (s, p and d) are used.

                          Starting XANES calculation
                     in the electric dipole approximation
     Method of calculation based on the Lanczos recursion algorithm
     --------------------------------------------------------------
        - STEP 1: Construction of a kpoint-dependent Lanczos basis,
          in which the Hamiltonian is tridiagonal (each 'iter' 
          corresponds to the calculation of one more Lanczos vector)
        - STEP 2: Calculation of the cross-section as a continued fraction
          averaged over the k-points.

     ... Begin STEP 1 ...
