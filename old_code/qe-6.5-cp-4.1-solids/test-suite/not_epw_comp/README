# This is a test to compare matrix elements produced directly by DFPT inside the PH code
# and matrix elements interpolated by EPW (S. Ponce and C. Verdi)

1) You need to copy the 3 src file onto PH to print the matrix elements
cp elphon.f90 phq_readin.f90 do_phonon.f90 symdyn_munu.f90 ../../../../PHonon/PH/

2) When you run ph-ref.in it will produce the data for the second k-points (k=2). 
You need to run the test in sequential.

3) Run EPW with prtgkk (run in seq. for safety)

You can compare the results.
