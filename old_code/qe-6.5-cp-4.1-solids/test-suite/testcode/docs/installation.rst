Installation
============

testcode2 is designed to be very lightweight and portable, so it can easily and
quickly be used on a variety of machines.  Typically only downloading the
testcode2 package is required.

If the :ref:`testcode.py` script is used, then no additional installation steps
are required assuming the directory structure is preserved.  If the
``testcode2`` module is used or the files are split up and installed elsewhere,
then the ``testcode2`` module must be able to be found by python (i.e. exists
on $PYTHONPATH).
