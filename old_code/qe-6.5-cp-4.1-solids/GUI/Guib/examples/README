This directory contains a few examples of simple GUIB definition
files. The *.tcl files are the definition files for GUIs, while *.inp
are corresponding input files as saved by the GUIs. They can be opened
using the File->Open menu of the corresponding GUIs.

To construct a given GUI you need to define the GUIB environmental
variable to point to the GUIB root directory. Then execute:

$GUIB/guib file.tcl

where file.tcl stands for a given example of *.tcl definition file.
