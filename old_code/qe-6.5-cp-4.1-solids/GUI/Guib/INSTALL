             * * * INSTALLATION instructions for GUIB * * *
 ==============================================================================

Because GUIB is written in [incr Tcl]---an extension of Tcl scripting
language----no compilation is needed.

*** HOWEVER *** the package depends on the [incr Tcl] and related
software (see SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS section below).


VERY SHORT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------------------

 1. untar the GUIB archive,
 2. define the GUIB environmental variable,


A BIT LONGER INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------------------------

To install the GUIB package do the following:

   1.) untar the *.tgz archive. use one of the following:

	gunzip -c guib.tgz | tar xvf -
     or
	gunzip guib.tgz; tar xvf guib.tar
     or 
        tar zxvf guib.tgz (for GNU tar program only)

   2.) define the GUIB environmental variable to point to the package
       root directory

     *  for Bourne compatible shells: GUIB=/guib/root/dir; export GUIB
     *  for Csh compatible shells:    setenv GUIB /guib/root/dir

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCE PACKAGE
----------------------------------------

The GUIB package depends on the following Tcl-related software:

	Tcl + Tk   >= 8.3
	Itcl + Itk >= 3.1
	Iwidgets   >= 3.0

The Itcl, Itk, and Iwidgets stand for: [incr Tcl], [incr Tk], and
[incr Widgets]. All these packages are usually already present on
modern Linux distributions, otherwise their RPMs (DEBs) can be easily
found on the WEB. 

See for example: http://incrtcl.sourceforge.net/


Troubleshooting
***************

For some RedHat distributions the "itkwish" package used to be broken,
while for some Debian distributions the "guib" used to crash if it was
called with "wish" package. If you experience such kind of troubles
then replace the call to "wish" ("itkwish") with "itkwish" ("wish") in
file "guib".
