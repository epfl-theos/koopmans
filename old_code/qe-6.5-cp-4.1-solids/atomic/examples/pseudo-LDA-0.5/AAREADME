This directory contains an example of how to generate a pseudo potential
with the LDA-1/2 correction. Two AE calculations are done one with the same
configuration as in the initial pseudopotential and an other one with 
a fraction less of electrons. Usually is 1/2 electron less however in the
silicon case 1/4 electron less is used (see ref. L. G. Ferreira, M. Marques 
and L. K. Teles, Phys. Rev. B 78 125116 (2008)). 

LDA-1/2 approach has been implemeted by Leonardo Matheus Marion Jorge, from
the University of Sao Paolo (Brazil).

The script test.job runs ld1.x (output in results dir.).
