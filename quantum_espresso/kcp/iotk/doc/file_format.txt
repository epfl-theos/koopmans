BINARY FILES
Iotk binary files are standard serial access Fortran binary files.
A binary file is then a collection of records, and each read/write
statement acts exactly on one of them.
Informations about the lengths of the tags are stored as integers
of kind equal to __IOTK_HEADER_KIND, which is predefined
to selected_int_kind(8). This should map to 32-bit integers.

Each tag is written on a pair of records.
The first record contains an header, the second one another header
and the tag, written as follows
write(unit) header
write
only an integer of kind equal to the macro __IOTK_HEADER_KIND.
If this macro is undefined, the default choice is selected_int_kind(8).
This usually leads to a 32 bit integer.

header  = control + taglenp*(iotk_ncontrol+1)
