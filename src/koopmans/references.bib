  abstract = {We propose a computational scheme for materials where standard local density approximation (LDA) fails to produce a satisfactory description of excitation energies. The method uses Slater's ``transition state'' approximation and Wannier functions basis set. We define a correction to LDA functional in such a way that its variation produces one-electron energies for Wannier functions equal to the energies obtained in transition state constrained LDA calculations. In the result eigenvalues of the proposed functional could be interpreted as excitation energies of the system under consideration. The method was applied to MgO, Si, NiO, and BaBiO3 and gave an improved agreement with experimental data of energy gap values comparing with LDA.}

  abstract = {Orbital-density-dependent functionals, such as the Perdew-Zunger or the Koopmans-compliant functionals, are used to remove unphysical self-interaction energies and to restore missing piece-wise linearity in approximate formulations of density-functional theory (DFT). At variance with functionals of the total density, orbital-density-dependent functionals are typically not invariant with respect to unitary transformations of the occupied states. Such additional degrees of freedom require an extension of established approaches for direct minimization that preserve their numerical robustness and efficiency, and make it possible to apply these advanced electronic-structure functionals to large or complex systems. In this work we adapt the ensemble-DFT algorithm [N. Marzari, D. Vanderbilt, and M. C. Payne, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 1337 (1997)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.79.1337] to the case of orbital-density-dependent functionals, partitioning the variational problem into a nested loop of (i) minimizations with respect to unitary transformations at a fixed orbital manifold, that lead to a projected, unitary-covariant functional of the orbitals only that enforces the Pederson condition and (ii) variational optimization of the orbital manifold for this projected functional. We discuss in detail both general and functional-dependent trends and suggest a procedure to efficiently exploit the combination of the different minimization strategies. The overall formulation allows for a stable, robust, and efficient algorithm, yielding great improvements over conventional techniques.}

Here, we present a general method to incorporate screening based on linear-response theory, and we apply it to the case of orbital-by-orbital screening of Koopmans' functionals. We illustrate the importance of such generalization when dealing with challenging systems containing orbitals with very different chemical character, also highlighting the simple dependence of the screening on the localization of the orbitals. We choose a set of 46 transition-metal complexes for which experimental data and accurate many-body perturbation theory calculations are available. When compared to experiment, results for ionization potentials show a very good performance, with a mean absolute error of 0.2 eV, comparable to the most accurate many-body perturbation theory approaches. These results reiterate the role of Koopmans-compliant functionals as simple and accurate quasiparticle approximations to the exact spectral functional, bypassing diagrammatic expansions and relying only on the physics of the local density or generalized-gradient approximation.}

Despite this, we show that Bloch symmetry can be preserved and it is possible to describe the electronic states with a band-structure picture, thanks to the Wannier-like character of the variational orbitals. We also present a method to unfold and interpolate the electronic bands from supercell ({$\Gamma$}-point) calculations, which enables us to calculate full band structures with Koopmans-compliant functionals.

However, commonly used approximate density functionals produce total energies that do not exhibit this piecewise-linear behavior. As a result, the ionization potential theorem, equating the highest occupied eigenvalue with the ionization potential, is grossly disobeyed. Here, we show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, most of the required piecewise linearity of an arbitrary approximate density functional can be restored by careful consideration of the ensemble generalization of density-functional theory. Furthermore, the resulting formulation introduces the desired derivative discontinuity to any approximate exchange-correlation functional, even one that is explicitly density dependent. This opens the door to calculations of the ionization potential and electron affinity, even without explicit electron removal or addition. All these advances are achieved while neither introducing empiricism nor changing the underlying functional form. The power of the approach is demonstrated on benchmark systems using the local density approximation as an illustrative example.}

  abstract = {Excitation gaps are of considerable significance in electronic structure theory. Two different gaps are of particular interest. The fundamental gap is defined by charged excitations, as the difference between the first ionization potential and the first electron affinity. The optical gap is defined by a neutral excitation, as the difference between the energies of the lowest dipole-allowed excited state and the ground state. Within many-body perturbation theory, the fundamental gap is the difference between the corresponding lowest quasi-hole and quasi-electron excitation energies, and the optical gap is addressed by including the interaction between a quasi-electron and a quasi-hole. A long-standing challenge has been the attainment of a similar description within density functional theory (DFT), with much debate on whether this is an achievable goal even in principle. Recently, we have constructed and applied a new approach to this problem. Anchored in the rigorous theoretical framework of the generalized Kohn\textendash Sham equation, our method is based on a range-split hybrid functional that uses exact long-range exchange. Its main novel feature is that the range-splitting parameter is not a universal constant but rather is determined from first principles, per system, based on satisfaction of the ionization potential theorem. For finite-sized objects, this DFT approach mimics successfully, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the quasi-particle picture of many-body theory. Specifically, it allows for the extraction of both the fundamental and the optical gap from one underlying functional, based on the HOMO\textendash LUMO gap of a ground-state DFT calculation and the lowest excitation energy of a linear-response time-dependent DFT calculation, respectively. In particular, it produces the correct optical gap for the difficult case of charge-transfer and charge-transfer-like scenarios, where conventional functionals are known to fail. In this perspective, we overview the formal and practical challenges associated with gap calculations, explain our new approach and how it overcomes previous difficulties, and survey its application to a variety of systems.}

  abstract = {Over the past decade we have developed Koopmans functionals, a computationally efficient approach for predicting spectral properties with an orbital-density-dependent functional formulation. These functionals address two fundamental issues with density functional theory (DFT). First, while Kohn-Sham eigenvalues can loosely mirror experimental quasiparticle energies, they are not meant to reproduce excitation energies and there is formally no connection between the two (except for the HOMO for the exact functional). Second, (semi-)local DFT deviates from the expected piecewise linear behavior of the energy as a function of the total number of electrons. This can make eigenvalues an even poorer proxy for quasiparticle energies and, together with the absence of the exchange-correlation derivative discontinuity, contributes to DFT's underestimation of band gaps. By enforcing a generalized piecewise linearity condition to the entire electronic manifold, Koopmans functionals yield molecular orbital energies and solid-state band structures with comparable accuracy to many-body perturbation theory but at greatly reduced computational cost and preserving a functional formulation. This paper introduces "koopmans", an open-source package that contains all of the code and workflows needed to perform Koopmans functional calculations without requiring expert knowledge. The theory and algorithms behind Koopmans functionals are summarized, and it is shown how one can easily use the koopmans package to obtain reliable spectral properties of molecules and materials.},

  abstract = {Standard flavors of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations are known to fail in describing anions, due to large self-interaction errors. The problem may be circumvented using localized basis sets of reduced size, leaving no variational flexibility for the extra electron to delocalize. Alternatively, a recent approach exploiting DFT evaluations of total energies on electronic densities optimized at the Hartree-Fock (HF) level has been reported, showing that the self-interaction-free HF densities are able to lead to an improved description of the additional electron, returning affinities in close agreement with the experiments. Nonetheless, such an approach can fail when the HF densities are too inaccurate. Here, an alternative approach is presented, in which an embedding environment is used to stabilize the anion in a bound configuration. Similar to the HF case, when computing total energies at the DFT level on these corrected densities, electron affinities in very good agreement with experiments can be recovered. The effect of the environment can be evaluated and removed by an extrapolation of the results to the limit of vanishing embedding. Apart from the definition of the domain of the embedding potential, the approach is free from parameters and it can be easily applied to DFT calculations with delocalized basis sets, e.g., plane waves, for which alternative approaches are either not viable or more computationally demanding. The proposed extrapolation strategy can be thus applied also to extended systems, as often studied in condensed-matter physics and materials science, and we illustrate how the embedding environment can be exploited to determine the energy of an adsorbing anion, here a chloride ion on a metal surface, whose charge configuration would be incorrectly predicted by standard density functionals.}

  abstract = {The need to interpret ultraviolet photoemission data strongly motivates the refinement of first-principles techniques that are able to accurately predict spectral properties. In this work, we employ Koopmans-compliant functionals, constructed to enforce piecewise linearity in approximate density functionals, to calculate the structural and electronic properties of DNA and RNA nucleobases. Our results show that not only ionization potentials and electron affinities are accurately predicted with mean absolute errors of {$<$}0.1 eV, but also that calculated photoemission spectra are in excellent agreement with experimental ultraviolet photoemission spectra. In particular, the role and contribution of different tautomers to the photoemission spectra are highlighted and discussed in detail. The structural properties of nucleobases are also investigated, showing an improved description with respect to local and semilocal density-functional theory. Methodologically, our results further consolidate the role of Koopmans-compliant functionals in providing, through orbital-density-dependent potentials, accurate electronic and spectral properties.}

Here, we propose a protocol to test publicly available pseudopotential libraries, based on several independent criteria including verification against all-electron equations of state and plane-wave convergence tests for phonon frequencies, band structure, cohesive energy and pressure. Adopting these criteria we obtain curated pseudopotential libraries (named SSSP or standard solid-state pseudopotential libraries), that we target for high-throughput materials screening (``SSSP efficiency'') and high-precision materials modelling (``SSSP precision''). This latter scores highest among open-source pseudopotential libraries available in the {$\Delta$}-factor test of equations of states of elemental solids.},

Using a newly developed set of molecules with heavy elements (called GW-SOC81), we find that, when based upon hybrid density functional calculations, fully relativistic (FR) and scalar-relativistic (SR) G0W0 calculations of vertical ionization potentials both yield excellent performance compared to experiment, with errors below 1.9\%. We demonstrate that while SR calculations have higher random errors, FR calculations systematically underestimate the VIP by 0.1 to 0.2 eV. We further verify that SOC effects may be well approximated at the FR density functional level and then added to SR G0W0 results for a broad class of systems. We also address the use of different root-finding algorithms for the G0W0 quasiparticle equation and the significant influence of including d electrons in the valence partition of the pseudopotential for G0W0 calculations. Finally, we present statistical analyses of our data, highlighting the importance of separating definitive improvements from those that may occur by chance due to a limited number of samples. We suggest the statistical analyses used here will be useful in the assessment of the accuracy of a large variety of electronic structure methods.}

The fraction of exact exchange included in the definition of DDH functionals depends (self-consistently) on the dielectric constant of the material. Here we introduce a range-separated (RS) version of DDH functionals where short- and long-range components are matched using system-dependent, nonempirical parameters. We show that RS-DDHs yield accurate electronic properties of inorganic and organic solids, including energy gaps and absolute ionization potentials. Furthermore we show that these functionals may be generalized to finite systems.}

  abstract = {First-principles calculations in crystalline structures are often performed with a planewave basis set. To make the number of basis functions tractable two approximations are usually introduced: core electrons are frozen and the diverging Coulomb potential near the nucleus is replaced by a smoother expression. The norm-conserving pseudopotential was the first successful method to apply these approximations in a fully ab initio way. Later on, more efficient and more exact approaches were developed based on the ultrasoft and the projector augmented wave formalisms. These formalisms are however more complex and developing new features in these frameworks is usually more difficult than in the norm-conserving framework. Most of the existing tables of norm-conserving pseudopotentials, generated long ago, do not include the latest developments, are not systematically tested or are not designed primarily for high precision. In this paper, we present our PseudoDojo framework for developing and testing full tables of pseudopotentials, and demonstrate it with a new table generated with the ONCVPSP approach. The PseudoDojo is an open source project, building on the AbiPy package, for developing and systematically testing pseudopotentials. At present it contains 7 different batteries of tests executed with ABINIT, which are performed as a function of the energy cutoff. The results of these tests are then used to provide hints for the energy cutoff for actual production calculations. Our final set contains 141 pseudopotentials split into a standard and a stringent accuracy table. In total around 70,000 calculations were performed to test the pseudopotentials. The process of developing the final table led to new insights into the effects of both the core-valence partitioning and the non-linear core corrections on the stability, convergence, and transferability of norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The PseudoDojo hence provides a set of pseudopotentials and general purpose tools for further testing and development, focusing on highly accurate calculations and their use in the development of ab initio packages. The pseudopotential files are available on the PseudoDojo web-interface pseudo-dojo.org under the name NC (ONCVPSP) v0.4 in the psp8, UPF2, and PSML 1.1 formats. The webinterface also provides the inputs, which are compatible with the 3.3.1 and higher versions of ONCVPSP. All tests have been performed with ABINIT 8.4.},
