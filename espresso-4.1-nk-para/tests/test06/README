@title@   Conjugate gradient minimization
==============================================================================
 
  The aim of this test is to show how to use the conjugate gradient method
  to solve the problem with ODD and orbital-dep functionals in general.
  When the functional is not unitary invariant, a innerloop strategy is also
  implemented and tested.
