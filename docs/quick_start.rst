Quick start
===========

1. install the code following the :ref:`installation instructions <Installation>`
2. download the :download:`input file for tutorial 1 <../tutorials/tutorial_1/ozone.json>`
3. run ``koopmans ozone.json``

Having done this, you have run your very first Koopmans calculation! You will see that a number of files have been generated. These contain the outputs of the calculation. For example, the ionisation potential and electron affinity of ozone are given by the negative of the HOMO and LUMO listed in the file ``final/ki_final.cpo``.
For more details, see :ref:`tutorial 1 <tutorial1>`.
