Tutorial 4: calculating electron affinities for small anions
============================================================
.. tip:: To run this tutorial, you will need a version of ``pw.x`` with the `environ <https://environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ patch installed.

The ``koopmans`` package can also calculate the PBE electron affinities of small molecules using the method of Nattino *et al.*. These anions are typically unbound (wrongly) by PBE, which means we cannot perform a standard ΔSCF calculation. Instead, the molecule is embedded within a cavity and finite difference calculations are performed with increasingly small values of :math:`\varepsilon_\infty`. See :cite:`Nattino2019` for a more detailed description.

Running these calculations is enabled with the ``environ_dscf`` task, and ``eps_cavity`` is a list of the trial values of :math:`\varepsilon_\infty` to use e.g.

so we can see that for :math:`\varepsilon_\infty = 2` the anion became unstable, as expected. If we perform a quartic fit to the energies (following the example of Nattino *et al.*) we can extrapolate back to :math:`\varepsilon_\infty = 1` to obtain the electron affinity of 1.30 eV.

.. warning::
  The `koopmans` implementation of this workflow differs from Nattino *et al.* in one major aspect: we use the same atomic positions for the anion as the neutral molecule. This means that we obtain *vertical* rather than *adiabatic* electron affinities. The reason for this choice is to be consistent with Koopmans spectral functionals, whose LUMO energies correspond to vertical electron affinities.
